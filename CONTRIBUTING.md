# Types of Contributions

## Report Bugs

Report bugs through [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW)

Please report relevant information and preferably code that exhibits
the problem.

## Fix Bugs

Look through the Jira issues for bugs. Anything is open to whoever wants
to implement it.

## Implement Features

Look through the [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW) for features.
Any unassigned "Improvement" issue is open to whoever wants to implement it.

We've created the operators, hooks, macros and executors we needed, but we
made sure that this part of Airflow is extensible. New operators,
hooks, macros and executors are very welcomed!

## Improve Documentation

Airflow could always use better documentation,
whether as part of the official Airflow docs,
in docstrings, `docs/*.rst` or even on the web as blog posts or
articles.

## Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to open an issue on
[Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW)

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

# Documentation

The latest API documentation is usually available
[here](https://airflow.apache.org/). To generate a local version,
you need to have set up an Airflow development environment (see below). Also
install the `doc` extra.

```
pip install -e '.[doc]'
```

Generate and serve the documentation by running:

```
cd docs
./build.sh
./start_doc_server.sh
```

# Setting up a development environment

There are three ways to setup an Apache Airflow development environment:

* [Local virtualenv development environment](#local-virtualenv-development-environment)
  using tools and libraries directly on your system
* [Docker container development environment](#docker-container-development-environment)
  using simple manually managed docker container
* [Integration test development environment](#integration-test-development-environment)
  using Docker compose based environment - the same that we use to run integration tests in Travis CI

##  Local virtualenv development environment

You can create local virtualenv with all requirements required by Airflow.

Advantage of local installation is that everything works locally, you do not have to enter Docker/container
environment and you can easily debug the code locally. You can also have access to python virtualenv that
contains all the necessary requirements and use it in your local IDE - this aids autocompletion, and
running tests directly from within the IDE.

The disadvantage is that you have to maintain your dependencies and local environment consistent with
other development environments that you have on your local machine.

Another disadvantage is that you you cannot run tests that require
external components - mysql, postgres database, hadoop, mongo, cassandra, redis etc..
The tests in Airflow are a mixture of unit and integration tests and some of them
require those components to be setup. Only real unit tests can be run bu default in local environment.

If you want to run integration tests, you need to configure and install the dependencies on your own.

It's also very difficult to make sure that your local environment is consistent with other's environments.
This  can often lead to "works for me" syndrome. It's better to use the Docker Compose integration test
environment in case you want reproducible environment consistent with other people.

### Installation

Install Python (3.5 or 3.6), MySQL, and libxml by using system-level package
managers like yum, apt-get for Linux, or Homebrew for Mac OS at first.
Refer to the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) for a comprehensive list of required packages.

In order to use your IDE you need you can use the virtual environment. Ideally
you should setup virtualenv for all python versions that Airflow supports (2.7, 3.5, 3.6).
An easy way to create the virtualenv is to use
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - it allows
you to easily switch between virtualenvs using `workon` command and mange
your virtual environments more easily. Typically creating the environment can be done by:

```
mkvirtualenv <ENV_NAME> --python=python<VERSION>
```

Then you need to install python PIP requirements. Typically it can be done with:
`pip install -e ".[devel]"`. Then you need to run `airflow initdb` to create sqlite database.

Once initialization is done, you should select the virtualenv you initialized as the
project's default virtualenv in your IDE and run tests efficiently.

After setting it up - you can use the usual "Run Test" option of the IDE and have
the autocomplete and documentation support from IDE as well as you can
debug and view the sources of Airflow - which is very helpful during
development.

### Running tests

To run tests locally, once you activate virtualenv you should be able to simply run
``run-tests`` at will. Note that if you want to pass extra parameters to nose
you should do it after '--'

For example, in order to just execute the "core" unit tests, run the following:

```bash
run-tests tests.core:CoreTest -- -s --logging-level=DEBUG
```
or a single test method:

```bash
run-tests tests.core:CoreTest.test_check_operators -- -s --logging-level=DEBUG
```

### Running tests directly from the IDE

Once you configure your tests to use the virtualenv you created. running tests
from IDE is as simple as:

![Run unittests](images/run_unittests.png)

Note that while most of the tests are typical "unit" tests that do not
require external components, there are a number of tests that are more of
"integration" ot even "system" tests (depending on the convention you use).
Those tests interact with external components. For those tests
you need to run complete Docker Compose - based
[Integration test development environment](#integration-test-development-environment).

## Docker container development environment

You can develop and run unit tests by using simple, manually managed docker container environment.

Advantage of Docker container is that your development environment is isolated from other development
environments you have and you can run quickly unit tests without messing with your local dependencies and
installation.

The disadvantage is that you you cannot run tests that require
external components - mysql, postgres database, hadoop, mongo, cassandra, redis etc..
The tests in Airflow are a mixture of unit and integration tests and some of them
require those components to be setup. Only real unit tests can be run here.

Also by default you have to start docker container airflow every time you want to run it.
You can persist the installation of airflow in your containers but this is fairly manual process.

### Installation

There are those prerequisites that you have to fulfill:

* Docker Community Edition installed and on the PATH. It should be
  configured to be able to run `docker` commands directly and not only via root user
  - your user should be in `docker` group. See [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

Go to your Airflow directory and start a new docker container. You can choose between
different versions of Python as base image - whatever you prefer. You can pick your own name
for the container if you do not want the name to be randomly assigned by docker.

```bash

# Start docker in your Airflow directory
docker run -t -i -v `pwd`:/airflow/ -w /airflow/ --name "airflow-3.6" python:3.6 bash

# To install all of airflows dependencies to run all tests (this is a lot)
pip install -e .

# To run only certain tests install the devel requirements and whatever is required
# for your test.  See setup.py for the possible requirements. For example:
pip install -e '.[gcp,devel]'

# Init the database
airflow initdb
```

Then while you are in the container you can run the tests with nosetests:

```
nosetests -v tests/hooks/test_druid_hook.py

  test_get_first_record (tests.hooks.test_druid_hook.TestDruidDbApiHook) ... ok
  test_get_records (tests.hooks.test_druid_hook.TestDruidDbApiHook) ... ok
  test_get_uri (tests.hooks.test_druid_hook.TestDruidDbApiHook) ... ok
  test_get_conn_url (tests.hooks.test_druid_hook.TestDruidHook) ... ok
  test_submit_gone_wrong (tests.hooks.test_druid_hook.TestDruidHook) ... ok
  test_submit_ok (tests.hooks.test_druid_hook.TestDruidHook) ... ok
  test_submit_timeout (tests.hooks.test_druid_hook.TestDruidHook) ... ok
  test_submit_unknown_response (tests.hooks.test_druid_hook.TestDruidHook) ... ok

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ran 8 tests in 3.036s

  OK
```

The Airflow code is mounted inside of the Docker container, so if you change something using your
favorite IDE, you can directly test it in the container.

You can persist your container so that you do not have to run install every time you enter the
environment. You can do it after you exit the container environment.

```bash
docker commit "airflow-3.6" "local-aiflow:3.6"
```

You can choose your own image label/tag to save the image as. Then you can enter back the environment with:

```bash
docker run -t -i -v `pwd`:/airflow/ -w /airflow/ "local-airflow:3.6" bash
```

### Running tests
Once you enter docker container you should be able to simply run
`run-tests` at will. Note that if you want to pass extra parameters to nose
you should do it after '--'

For example, in order to just execute the "core" unit tests, run the following:
```bash
run-tests tests.core:CoreTest -- -s --logging-level=DEBUG
```
or a single test method:
```bash
run-tests tests.core:CoreTest.test_check_operators -- -s --logging-level=DEBUG
```
or another example:
```
./run_unit_tests.sh tests.contrib.operators.test_dataproc_operator:DataprocClusterCreateOperatorTest.test_create_cluster_deletes_error_cluster  -s --logging-level=DEBUG
```

Alternatively, you can also set up [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) on your repo to automate this.
It is free for open source projects.

### Running static code analysis locally

We have a number of static code checks that are run in Travis CI but you can run them locally as well.
All the scripts are available in [scripts/ci](scripts/ci/) folder.

* [ci_check_license.sh](scripts/ci/ci_check_license.sh) - checks if all licences are present in source files.
  This script requires java and runs in host environment - this means that the check can behave differently
  on your machine than in the Travis CI.

The other checks below are run in a docker environment, which means that if you run them locally,
they should give the same results as the tests run in TravisCI without special environment preparation:

* [ci_docs.sh](scripts/ci/ci_docs.sh) - checks that documentation can be built without warnings.
  Documentation is available in [docs/_build/html](docs/_build/html) folder after the script is run
  and succeeds.
* [ci_flake8.sh](scripts/ci/ci_flake8.sh) - runs flake8 source code style guide enforcement tool
* [ci_mypy.sh](scripts/ci/ci_mypy.sh) - runs mypy type annotation consistency check
* [ci_pylint.sh](scripts/ci/ci_pylint.sh) - runs pylint static code checker
* [ci_lint_dockerfile.sh](scripts/ci/ci_lint_dockerfile.sh) - runs lint checker for the Dockerfile

### Pylint checks (work in-progress)

Note that for pylint we are in the process of fixing pylint code checks for the whole Airflow code. This is
a huge task so we implemented an incremental approach for the process. Currently most of the code is
excluded from pylint checks via [pylint_todo.txt](scripts/ci/pylint_todo.txt). We have an open JIRA
issue [AIRFLOW-4364](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4364) which has a number of
sub-tasks for each of the modules that should be made compatible. Fixing pylint problems is one of
straightforward and easy tasks to do (but time-consuming) so if you are a first-time contributor to
Airflow you can choose one of the sub-tasks as your first issue to fix. The process to fix the issue looks
as follows:

1) Remove module/modules from the [pylint_todo.txt](scripts/ci/pylint_todo.txt)
2) Run [ci_pylint.sh](scripts/ci/ci_pylint.sh)
3) Fix all the issues reported by pylint
4) Re-run [ci_pylint.sh](scripts/ci/ci_pylint.sh)
5) If you see "success" - submit PR following [Pull Request guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)

There are following guidelines when fixing pylint errors:

* Ideally fix the errors rather than disable pylint checks - often you can easily refactor the code
  (IntelliJ/PyCharm might be helpful when extracting methods in complex code or moving methods around)
* When disabling particular problem - make sure to disable only that error-via the symbolic name
  of the error as reported by pylint
* If there is a single line where to disable particular error you can add comment following the line
  that causes the problem. For example:
```python
def MakeSummary(pcoll, metric_fn, metric_keys):  # pylint: disable=invalid-name
```
* When there are multiple lines/block of code to disable an error you can surround the block with
  comment only pylint:disable/pylint:enable lines. For example:

```python
# pylint: disable=too-few-public-methods
class LoginForm(Form):
    """Form for the user"""
    username = StringField('Username', [InputRequired()])
    password = PasswordField('Password', [InputRequired()])
# pylint: enable=too-few-public-methods
```

### Git hooks

Another great way of automating linting and testing is to use
 [Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/uz/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks). For example you could create a
`pre-commit` file based on the Travis CI Pipeline so that before each commit a local pipeline will be
triggered and if this pipeline fails (returns an exit code other than `0`) the commit does not come through.
This "in theory" has the advantage that you can not commit any code that fails that again reduces the
errors in the Travis CI Pipelines.

Since there are a lot of tests the script would last very long so you probably only should test your
 new
feature locally.

The following example of a `pre-commit` file allows you..
- to lint your code via flake8
- to test your code via nosetests in a docker container based on python 2
- to test your code via nosetests in a docker container based on python 3

```
#!/bin/sh

GREEN='\033[0;32m'
NO_COLOR='\033[0m'

setup_python_env() {
    local venv_path=${1}

    echo -e "${GREEN}Activating python virtual environment ${venv_path}..${NO_COLOR}"
    source ${venv_path}
}
run_linting() {
    local project_dir=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)

    echo -e "${GREEN}Running flake8 over directory ${project_dir}..${NO_COLOR}"
    flake8 ${project_dir}
}
run_testing_in_docker() {
    local feature_path=${1}
    local airflow_py2_container=${2}
    local airflow_py3_container=${3}

    echo -e "${GREEN}Running tests in ${feature_path} in airflow python 2 docker container..${NO_COLOR}"
    docker exec -i -w /airflow/ ${airflow_py2_container} nosetests -v ${feature_path}
    echo -e "${GREEN}Running tests in ${feature_path} in airflow python 3 docker container..${NO_COLOR}"
    docker exec -i -w /airflow/ ${airflow_py3_container} nosetests -v ${feature_path}
}

set -e
# NOTE: Before running this make sure you have set the function arguments correctly.
setup_python_env /Users/feluelle/venv/bin/activate
run_linting
run_testing_in_docker tests/contrib/hooks/test_imap_hook.py dazzling_chatterjee quirky_stallman

```

For more information on how to run a subset of the tests, take a look at the
nosetests docs.

See also the list of test classes and methods in `tests/core.py`.

Feel free to customize based on the extras available in [setup.py](./setup.py)

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request from your forked repo, check that it
meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests, either as doctests, unit tests, or both. The airflow repo uses
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/apache/airflow) to run the tests and
[codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow) to track coverage.
You can set up both for free on your fork (see the "Testing on Travis CI" section below).
It will help you making sure you do not break the build with your PR and that you help increase coverage.
1. Please [rebase your fork](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7244456/1110993), squash commits, and
resolve all conflicts.
1. Every pull request should have an associated
[JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel).
The JIRA link should also be contained in the PR description.
1. Preface your commit's subject & PR's title with **[AIRFLOW-XXX]** where *XXX* is the JIRA number.
We compose release notes (i.e. for Airflow releases) from all commit titles in a release.
By placing the JIRA number in the commit title and hence in the release notes, Airflow users can look into
JIRA and GitHub PRs for more details about a particular change.
1. Add an [Apache License](http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html) header to all new files
1. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated as part of the same PR. Doc string
are often sufficient.  Make sure to follow the Sphinx compatible standards.
1. The pull request should work for Python 3.5 and 3.6.
1. As Airflow grows as a project, we try to enforce a more consistent style and try to follow the Python
community guidelines. We currently enforce most [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and a
few other linting rules - described in [Running linting and tests](#running-linting-and-tests). It's a good
idea to run tests locally before opening PR.
1. Please read this excellent [article](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) on commit messages and
adhere to them. It makes the lives of those who come after you a lot easier.

### Testing on Travis CI

We currently rely heavily on Travis CI for running the full Airflow test suite
as running all of the tests locally requires significant setup.  You can setup
Travis CI in your fork of Airflow by following the
[Travis CI Getting Started guide][travis-ci-getting-started].

There are two different options available for running Travis CI which are
setup as separate components on GitHub:

1. **Travis CI GitHub App** (new version)
1. **Travis CI GitHub Services** (legacy version)

#### Travis CI GitHub App (new version)

1. Once installed, you can configure the Travis CI GitHub App at
https://github.com/settings/installations -> Configure Travis CI.

1. For the Travis CI GitHub App, you can set repository access to either "All
repositories" for convenience, or "Only select repositories" and choose
`<username>/airflow` in the dropdown.

1. You can access Travis CI for your fork at
`https://travis-ci.com/<username>/airflow`.

#### Travis CI GitHub Services (legacy version)

The Travis CI GitHub Services versions uses an Authorized OAuth App.  Note
that `apache/airflow` is currently still using the legacy version.

1. Once installed, you can configure the Travis CI Authorized OAuth App at
https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/88c5b97de2dbfc50f3ac.

1. If you are a GitHub admin, click the "Grant" button next to your
organization; otherwise, click the "Request" button.

1. For the Travis CI Authorized OAuth App, you may have to grant access to the
forked `<organization>/airflow` repo even though it is public.

1. You can access Travis CI for your fork at
`https://travis-ci.org/<organization>/airflow`.

#### Prefer travis-ci.com over travis-ci.org

The travis-ci.org site for open source projects is now legacy and new projects
should instead be created on travis-ci.com for both private repos and open
source.

Note that there is a second Authorized OAuth App available called "Travis CI
for Open Source" used for the
[legacy travis-ci.org service][travis-ci-org-vs-com].  It should not be used
for new projects.

### Changing the Metadata Database

When developing features the need may arise to persist information to the the
metadata database. Airflow has [Alembic](https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/alembic)
built-in to handle all schema changes. Alembic must be installed on your
development machine before continuing.

```
# starting at the root of the project
$ pwd
~/airflow
# change to the airflow directory
$ cd airflow
$ alembic revision -m "add new field to db"
  Generating
~/airflow/airflow/migrations/versions/12341123_add_new_field_to_db.py
```

## Setting up the node / npm javascript environment

`airflow/www/` contains all npm-managed, front end assets.
Flask-Appbuilder itself comes bundled with jQuery and bootstrap.
While these may be phased out over time, these packages are currently not
managed with npm.

### Node/npm versions

Make sure you are using recent versions of node and npm. No problems have been found with node>=8.11.3 and
npm>=6.1.3

### Using npm to generate bundled files

#### npm

First, npm must be available in your environment. If you are on Mac and it is not installed,
you can run the following commands (taken from [this source](https://gist.github.com/DanHerbert/9520689)):

```
brew install node --without-npm
echo prefix=~/.npm-packages >> ~/.npmrc
curl -L https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh
```

The final step is to add `~/.npm-packages/bin` to your `PATH` so commands you install globally are usable.
Add something like this to your `.bashrc` file, then `source ~/.bashrc` to reflect the change.

```
export PATH="$HOME/.npm-packages/bin:$PATH"
```

You can also follow
[the general npm installation instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

#### npm packages

To install third party libraries defined in `package.json`, run the
following within the `airflow/www/` directory which will install them in a
new `node_modules/` folder within `www/`.

```bash
# from the root of the repository, move to where our JS package.json lives
cd airflow/www/
# run npm install to fetch all the dependencies
npm install
```

To parse and generate bundled files for airflow, run either of the
following commands. The `dev` flag will keep the npm script running and
re-run it upon any changes within the assets directory.

```
# Compiles the production / optimized js & css
npm run prod

# Start a web server that manages and updates your assets as you modify them
npm run dev
```

#### Upgrading npm packages

Should you add or upgrade a npm package, which involves changing `package.json`, you'll need to re-run `npm install`
and push the newly generated `package-lock.json` file so we get the reproducible build.

#### Javascript Style Guide

We try to enforce a more consistent style and try to follow the JS community guidelines.
Once you add or modify any javascript code in the project, please make sure it follows the guidelines
defined in [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
Apache Airflow uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) as a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns
in JavaScript, which can be used by running any of the following commands.

```bash
# Check JS code in .js and .html files, and report any errors/warnings
npm run lint

# Check JS code in .js and .html files, report any errors/warnings and fix them if possible
npm run lint:fix
```
